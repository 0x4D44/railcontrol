# Baseline Asset Checklist (Stage 0)

This checklist captures the reference artifacts required before beginning the MSVC/OWLNext migration. Items marked **TODO** still need collection from an environment that can build with Borland C++ 5.02.

## Build Outputs
- [ ] `railc.exe` compiled with Borland C++ 5.02 + OWLNext 6.30 (**TODO – requires legacy toolchain**)
- [ ] Link map / map file from Borland linker (**TODO**)
- [ ] Resource binary `railc.res` generated via `brc32` (**TODO**)
- [ ] `railc.sym` / debug symbols if available (**n/a** – Borland)

## Configuration Snapshots
- [x] `BccW32.cfg`, `BccW32_local.cfg`, `BccW32_simple.cfg` (already versioned)
- [x] `link.rsp` and variants (already versioned)
- [ ] `RAILC.INI` default generated by a clean run (**TODO – capture from executable**)

## Help & Resources
- [x] `RAILC.HLP` (existing in repo)
- [x] `RESOURCE\railc.rc`, bitmaps, icons (existing)
- [x] `HELP\` WinHelp sources (existing)

## Smoke Test Evidence
- [ ] Screenshots of key UI windows from Borland build (**TODO**)
- [ ] Notes on manual smoke test behaviour (delays, known quirks) (**TODO**)

## Storage Location
- Planned archive directory: `artifacts/legacy/2025-10/` (to be created once artifacts are available).

# Rail Control .RCD File Format Guide

This guide reverse-engineers the text format consumed by `TLayout::ReadDataFile` (LAYOUT.CPP:1907+) and cross-checks it with the sample layouts in the repository (FAST.RCD, KINGSX.RCD, WAVERLY88.RCD). Use it when authoring new timetable/simulation files.

## File-Wide Conventions
- Plain ASCII text with CRLF line endings. The loader streams the file via `std::ifstream`, so stray binary bytes will halt parsing.
- Section headers `[NAME]` are case-insensitive. The loader re-reads the file for each section, so order is flexible, but following the canonical sequence below aids review.
- Every required section must appear exactly once. Missing or duplicate sections trigger a modal error and abort loading.
- Fields are comma-separated. Whitespace around commas is ignored. If the final numeric field on a line is omitted, the loader treats it as zero.
- Numeric fields are signed decimal integers. Times are written as 24-hour `HHMM` integers (for example `0645`).
- Comments are only recognised in `[TIMETABLE]` lines: text after `#` is stored as that entry's comment.
- Array sizes are fixed at compile time; exceeding them fails the load.
- Keep each data line left-aligned and avoid blank lines inside a section. The parser stops reading a section as soon as it encounters a leading space or an empty line.
- `[TIMETABLE]` is the only section that supports inline comments, and the `#` must appear in the final (reassignable-loco) field.
- Section keywords are compared case-insensitively, but individual keys inside `[GENERAL]` (`StartTime`, etc.) are case-sensitive matches against the literals in the code.
- Comment lines beginning with `;`, `//`, or other tokens are not supported; the loader treats them as data and will usually bail out of the section.
- Leading and trailing whitespace on tokens is trimmed, but there is no quoting support. Stick to plain ASCII words/numbers separated by commas.
- Integer fields are parsed with standard C `atoi` calls. Leading zeros are allowed, but any stray characters after the numeric portion are ignored, so keep tokens strictly numeric.

### String limits
| Field | Source buffer | Maximum characters (excluding NUL) |
|-------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `StartText1..3` | `StartText[3][100]` (LAYOUT.CPP) | 99 |
| Selector label (`Label`) | `TSelector::MainText[5]` (SELECTOR.CPP:142) | 4 |
| Arrival/Departure descriptions | `mArrDesc[25]` / `mDepDesc[25]` (TIMETABL.CPP:28) | 24 |
| Timetable comment | `TT_CMT_LEN` (TIMETABL.H:17) | 199 |

- None of the text fields support quoting. Avoid commas (`,`) and `#` characters inside descriptions or labels because the parser treats them as delimiters.

### Time encoding
- All clock fields are supplied as integers in `HHMM` format with minutes `< 60`. The loader converts them to its internal half-minute representation via `PackTime`, so keep the source values on whole-minute boundaries to avoid wrap-around artifacts.
- Release offsets (`ReleaseOffset`) are read as integers and later added to the arrival time when a train starts in-platform. You can specify bare minutes (`5`) or `HHMM` style (`0105`); the resulting sum should stay within a valid 24-hour clock window.
- Internally the working clock (`WorkTime`, `StopTime`, etc.) advances in half-minute ticks (value increments of 1 represent 30 seconds). Bear this in mind when reasoning about how quickly the simulation reacts to timetable events.

### Required sections
`ReadDataFile` seeks each block individually and expects every scenario file to define at least the following sections: `[SECTIONS]`, `[GENERAL]`, `[OVERLAPPING]`, `[PLATFORMS]`, `[SELECTOR]`, `[ROUTES]`, `[LOCOS]`, `[LOCOYARD]`, and `[TIMETABLE]`. Missing any of them triggers error 10001.

### Capacity limits
| Structure | Array size | Valid IDs |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Sections (`PSectionInfo`) | 1000 | 1-999 |
| Overlap pairs (`POverlapDataInfo`) | 50 | 1-49 |
| Platforms (`PPlatDataInfo`) | 50 | 1-49 |
| Selectors (`PSelectorInfo`) | 50 | 1-49 |
| Routes (`PRoutesInfo`) | 1000 | 1-999 |
| Locomotives (`PLocosInfo`) | 500 | 1-499 |
| Timetable entries (`PTimetableInfo`) | 500 (`MAX_TIMETABLE`) | 1-499 |
| Locoyard slots (`LocoyardLoco`) | 16 | implicit |

## Section Reference
### [GENERAL]
Key-value pairs controlling the session. Required keys:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `StartTime` | Shift start time (HHMM). Stored internally as packed minutes in `WorkTime`. |
| `StopTime` | Shift end time (HHMM). Must be greater than `StartTime`; used to compute `ShiftLength`. |
| `StartText1`..`StartText3` | Lines shown in the start dialog. Optional; default to empty strings. |
| `DrawSectionNumber` | Optional. `T`/`F`. When `T`, section IDs are painted on the layout for debugging. |
| `DrawSelectorNumber` | Optional. `T`/`F`. When `T`, selector buttons show their numeric ID instead of the label text. |

Any other tokens are ignored. Missing `StartTime`/`StopTime` or inverted times cause a load failure.
If the debug flags are omitted they default to `FALSE`. `StartText` strings are copied verbatim into 99-character buffers, so keep them short enough to avoid truncation.
Both `StartTime` and `StopTime` must express valid 24-hour times (`HHMM` with minutes < 60).
If `StartTime >= StopTime` or either value is zero the loader reports message 10000 and aborts.
- Define each key only once; duplicates overwrite silently and may leave stale values in memory.
`DrawSectionNumber` and `DrawSelectorNumber` only inspect the first character of the value. Use `T` or `F` (upper or lower case) and avoid longer words such as "True".

### [SECTIONS]
Defines the track polygons used for occupancy and rendering.

Format per line: `SectionID, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`

- `SectionID` must be unique in 1-999.
- The four coordinate pairs describe a quadrilateral in screen pixels (Borland OWL coordinate space). The loader stores them verbatim; use a consistent winding order.
- Section IDs are referenced by routes, overlaps, selectors (hold point), and timetable logic. Any referenced ID must exist here.
- Out-of-range or duplicate section IDs abort the load (messages 10002/10003).
- Coordinates are parsed as integers. Stick to whole pixels; fractional values are not supported.

### [OVERLAPPING]
Declares mutually-exclusive sections that must be clear before a route can be set.

Format: `RuleID, SectionA, SectionB`

- `RuleID` 1-49 unique (the ID itself is only used as a lookup slot).
- `SectionA`/`SectionB` reference existing section IDs. Either may be `0` to disable the slot.
- The loader checks these pairs whenever it validates or clears routes.
- Invalid ranges or duplicate rule IDs raise the standard range/duplicate errors (10002/10003).

### [PLATFORMS]
Defines platform polygons and their linkage to selectors/timetables.

Format per line: `PlatformID, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`

- `PlatformID` 1-49, unique.
- Each platform must later be associated with a selector of type 3 or 4; the loader enforces this after `[SELECTOR]`.
- Duplicate IDs or values outside 1-49 abort the load. After `[SELECTOR]` processing the loader also checks that every platform has a selector, otherwise it throws message 10012.
- The `Reference` column is not used here; the linkage to selectors happens later when `[SELECTOR]` is parsed.

### [SELECTOR]
Defines clickable control buttons (inputs, outputs, platforms, hold point, loco yard).

Format: `SelectorID, X, Y, Width, Height, Type, Reference, Label`

- `SelectorID`: 1-49, unique.
- `X`, `Y`, `Width`, `Height`: window rectangle in pixels.
- `Type`: integer mapped to the constants below.

| Type | Constant | Meaning | Reference field |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | `SEL_INPUT` | Entry line | Unused (`0`) |
| 2 | `SEL_OUTPUT` | Exit line | Unused |
| 3 | `SEL_PLAT` | Non-electrified platform | Platform ID (1-49) |
| 4 | `SEL_ELECTRIC_PLAT` | Electrified platform | Platform ID (1-49) |
| 5 | `SEL_HOLD` | Hold point selector | Section ID marking the hold block |
| 6 | `SEL_LOCOYARD` | Loco yard selector | Unused |

Additional rules:
- Platform types (3/4) must reference an existing platform; each platform must have exactly one selector (`SetSelectorRef` enforces this).
- The first type-5 selector sets the global hold point and hold section; subsequent duplicates degrade to type 4.
- The first type-6 selector sets the global locoyard selector; later duplicates degrade to type 4.
- `Label` is rendered on the button unless `DrawSelectorNumber=T`, in which case the numeric ID is shown.
- Labels longer than four characters are truncated on load.
- Type-5 selectors treat `Reference` as a section ID; ensure the referenced section exists.
- Selector IDs must stay within 1-49 and be unique. Invalid or missing platform references for type-3/4 selectors raise errors 10010/10011.
- For type-1/2 selectors leave the `Reference` value at `0`; for type-3/4 selectors it must match the platform ID defined in `[PLATFORMS]`.

### [ROUTES]
Enumerates allowable paths between selectors and the sections that must remain clear.

Format: `RouteID, FromSelector, ToSelector, Clear0, Clear1, Clear2, Clear3, Clear4, Clear5`

- `RouteID`: 1-999, unique.
- `FromSelector`, `ToSelector`: selector IDs defined in `[SELECTOR]`.
- Each `ClearN` encodes up to two section IDs: `value = Primary + 1000 * Secondary`. Example: `56061` means primary section 61, secondary section 56. Use `0` when no section is involved.
- Every referenced section must exist; invalid IDs abort the load.
- The six entries correspond to the arrival/approach stages (`ST_ARRA`..`ST_ARRF`) and, by reuse, the departure stages (`ST_DEPA`..`ST_DEPF`).
- Route availability checks also honour `[OVERLAPPING]` pairs.
- All six stage fields must be present, even if some are zero. Duplicate route IDs trigger message 10003.
- Undefined selectors in the `From`/`To` fields raise message 10005; undefined sections in the clear stages raise 10004.
- When `Primary` is zero and `Secondary` is non-zero the loader still validates the secondary section, so encode a single-section stage as plain `SectionID`.
- Stage index -> status mapping:

  | Stage | Arrival status | Departure status |
  |-------|----------------|------------------|
  | 0 | `ST_ARRA` | `ST_DEPA` |
  | 1 | `ST_ARRB` | `ST_DEPB` |
  | 2 | `ST_ARRC` | `ST_DEPC` |
  | 3 | `ST_ARRD` | `ST_DEPD` |
  | 4 | `ST_ARRE` | `ST_DEPE` |
  | 5 | `ST_ARRF` | `ST_DEPF` |

  Use this to ensure the correct sections are cleared as trains progress through the block diagram.
- `ClearN` values are encoded as `primary + 1000 * secondary`. The primary section ID occupies the low-order digits; the optional secondary section is stored in the thousands place. Example: `5006` means "keep sections 6 and 5 clear during this stage." Keep both IDs within 1-999 so they decode correctly.

### [LOCOS]
Defines the locomotive roster.

Format: `LocoID, Class, Number, StockCode`

- `LocoID`: 1-499, unique.
- `Class`: integer prefix (for example `31`, `254`).
- `Number`: running number (0-999). Leading zeros may be written (`001`).
- `StockCode`: any `SC_*` constant (table below). Every loco starts with flag `LF_UNASSIGN`.
- The loader does not range-check `StockCode` here, but `AssignLoco` later relies on the value matching a defined `SC_*` constant.
- The pair (`Class`,`Number`) is combined into a single identifier (`Class*1000 + Number`). Keep `Number` within 0-999 so the digits do not spill into the thousands place.

### [LOCOYARD]
Initialises locomotives in the yard or disables the feature.

- If the first line is `Disabled`, the loader sets `LocoyardEnabled = FALSE` and skips the rest of the section.
- Otherwise each line: `StockCode, RefuelOffsetMinutes`
  - `StockCode`: allowed values are 1-6 and 10-12 (ECS, HST, EMU, Deltic, Standard, Relief, Push/Pull, DMU, Class 37). Any other value is ignored.
  - `RefuelOffsetMinutes`: 0-59. The loader calls `AssignYardLoco` at `StartTime + offset`. With refuelling enabled, non-zero offsets mark the loco `LF_REFUEL` until the time elapses.
- Locos are chosen randomly from the pool of free locomotives matching the requested stock code.
- Lines with disallowed stock codes are silently skipped; no error dialog is raised.
- Offsets are added directly to the packed `WorkTime`, so treat them as minutes (whole numbers) to match the existing scenarios.
- The sentinel word `Disabled` is matched case-insensitively.
- The yard can host up to 16 live entries (`LocoyardLoco[16]`), so seeding more than 16 lines will queue locomotives but only the first 16 will be visible at start-up.

### [TIMETABLE]
Defines trains and light-engine moves.

Format:
`EntryID, ArrivalDescription, DepartureDescription, ArrSelector, ArrTime, ReleaseOffset, DepTime, ArrStock, DepStock, Status, Extra, NextEntry # Optional comment`

| Pos | Field | Meaning | Validation |
|-----|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | `EntryID` | Timetable ID. | 1-499, unique. |
| 2 | `ArrivalDescription` | Text shown in arrival lists (trimmed to 24 chars). | Required string, avoid commas/`#`. |
| 3 | `DepartureDescription` | Text shown in departure lists. | Required string, avoid commas/`#`. |
| 4 | `ArrSelector` | Selector where the train appears (`mArrPnt`). | Must reference a selector of type `SEL_INPUT` (1-49). |
| 5 | `ArrTime` | Scheduled arrival (`HHMM`). | Minutes `< 60`. |
| 6 | `ReleaseOffset` | Minutes to release stock after arrival. Added to the arrival time when the train starts in-platform. | Use whole minutes (e.g. `5` or `0105`). |
| 7 | `DepTime` | Scheduled departure (`HHMM`). | Minutes `< 60`. |
| 8 | `ArrStock` | Incoming stock code (`SC_*`). | Must be valid. |
| 9 | `DepStock` | Outgoing stock code. | Must be valid. |
|10 | `Status` | Initial status enum (`ST_*`). Typical seeds: `ST_NONE`, `ST_HELD`, `ST_INPLAT`, `ST_STOCKOK`, `ST_TWINASSOC`. | 0-30 allowed; other values reserved for runtime. |
|11 | `Extra` | Context-sensitive field (see below). | Range depends on `Status`. |
|12 | `NextEntry` | Timetable ID that inherits the loco (`mNextTimeTabPos`). | `0` or an existing entry `< 500`. |

Comments:
- Only text after `#` in the final field is stored as the entry comment (trimmed to 199 characters).
- If the comment contains `Becomes <text>`, the loader verifies `<text>` matches the arrival description of the entry referenced by `NextEntry`.
- Omitting the final numeric field implicitly sets `NextEntry` to `0`.
- Whitespace around each comma-delimited value is stripped automatically; keep strings tidy to avoid accidental trailing spaces inside the saved descriptions.
- Even when a train starts off-layout (`Status = ST_NONE`) you must supply a valid input selector in `ArrSelector`; the loader uses it when the service enters and raises error 10006 otherwise.
- Non-zero `NextEntry` values must reference an existing timetable entry (`1-499`) and use matching stock codes. Otherwise the loader stops with messages 10008 or 10009.
- The comparison for `Becomes` is case-sensitive and uses the fully-trimmed arrival description, so copy the target text exactly (spacing and casing included).
- `ArrTime` and `DepTime` accept values beyond the nominal operating window (for example late-evening services), but keep minutes < 60 to avoid wrap-around when time arithmetic runs.
- Avoid pointing `NextEntry` back to the same timetable ID or creating loops; while the loader does not reject cycles explicitly, interlocking logic assumes the chain eventually terminates.
- Supply all 12 comma-separated values even when the later fields are `0`. Always include the `NextEntry` placeholder before any `#` comment text so the parser does not misalign the fields.
- Stick to four-digit, zero-padded times (`0630`, `2359`) for readability and to match the original scenarios.
- Duplicate `EntryID` values trigger message 10003; keep the numbering contiguous to make debugging easier.
- `ReleaseOffset` is ignored while a train is off-layout (`Status = ST_NONE`, etc.) and only applied if the stock begins in a platform (`ST_INPLAT`, `ST_STOCKOK`).
Example entry (no comment):

  `101, Morning ECS, Morning Departure, 3, 0730, 0, 0745, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0`

Example linking entry with comment:

  `102, Late Arrival, Late Departure, 4, 0810, 5, 0820, 5, 5, 12, 4, 101 # Becomes Morning ECS`


`Extra` field by status:

| Status | Constant | `Extra` usage |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| `0` | `ST_NONE` | Delay flag (`DLF_*`). |
| `12` | `ST_INPLAT` | Platform ID (1-14) holding the train at start. |
| `14` | `ST_STOCKOK` | Platform ID (1-14) where stock awaits a new loco. |
| `30` | `ST_TWINASSOC` | Timetable ID of the associated twin unit. |
| Others | varies | Typically `0`; these states are intended for runtime transitions only. |

Practical starting statuses:
- `ST_NONE` (0) for trains that begin off-stage. Set `Extra` to one of the `DLF_*` delay flags.
- `ST_HELD` (3) for trains waiting at an approach signal. Leave `Extra` at `0`.
- `ST_INPLAT` (12) for trains already berthed; `Extra` supplies the platform ID (1-14).
- `ST_STOCKOK` (14) for stock in-platform awaiting a new locomotive; supply the platform ID (1-14).
- `ST_TWINASSOC` (30) for the second part of a coupled set. `Extra` must point at the timetable entry for the lead unit that physically arrives. The loader promotes the twin to `ST_INPLAT` automatically when its partner berths.
- `ReleaseOffset` is honoured only when the train starts in-platform (`ST_INPLAT`/`ST_STOCKOK`); in other cases the value is ignored until the train arrives.

Let the simulation engine drive the intermediate arrival (`ST_ARRA`..`ST_ARRF`) and departure (`ST_DEPA`..`ST_DEPF`) stages; seeding timetable rows with those values often creates inconsistent state.

Status codes (`GENERAL.H`):

| Code | Constant | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | `ST_DUE` | Due but not yet approaching. |
| 2 | `ST_APPROACH` | Approaching the layout. |
| 3 | `ST_HELD` | Held outside the station. |
| 4-11 | `ST_FIRSTHELD`..`ST_ARRF` | Arrival stages A-F. |
| 12 | `ST_INPLAT` | Train stands in platform at start. |
| 13 | `ST_RELEASE` | Stock released, requires loco. |
| 14 | `ST_STOCKOK` | Stock ready to depart after loco swap. |
| 15 | `ST_READYDEP` | Ready within five minutes of departure. |
| 16-22 | `ST_STARTDEP`..`ST_DEPF` | Departure stages A-F. |
| 30 | `ST_TWINASSOC` | Twin-unit association. |

Delay flags (`DLF_*` when `Status = 0`):

| Code | Constant | Behaviour |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | `DLF_NODELAYS` | No random delay. |
| 1 | `DLF_DELAYS` | Allow early/late variance. |
| 2 | `DLF_DELAYS_MAINT` | Maintenance delay profile. |
| 3 | `DLF_DELAYS_THRU` | Through-service delay profile. |
| 4 | `DLF_ONLYLATE` | Only late running; early arrivals forced on time. |
| 5 | `DLF_ONLYLATE_THRU` | Through-service, no early arrivals. |

- `DLF_DELAYS_THRU` and `DLF_ONLYLATE_THRU` mark the service as a through train: the loader skips platform occupation and drives the status straight into departure stages.
- `DLF_ONLYLATE` and `DLF_ONLYLATE_THRU` clamp any simulated early running back to on-time before the delay profile is applied.
- `DLF_DELAYS_MAINT` marks the locomotive for maintenance (`LF_MAINTAIN`) after arrival, so schedule additional slack or yard capacity.

Stock codes (`SC_*`):

| Code | Constant | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `SC_ECS` | ECS set (Class 31). |
| 2 | `SC_HST` | HST set. |
| 3 | `SC_EMU` | EMU set. |
| 4 | `SC_DELTIC` | Deltic express. |
| 5 | `SC_NORMAL` | Standard passenger (Class 40/45/46/47). |
| 6 | `SC_RELIEF` | Relief passenger. |
| 7 | `SC_LIGHTECS` | Light engine for ECS. |
| 8 | `SC_LIGHTNORM` | Light standard engine. |
| 9 | `SC_LIGHTDELT` | Light Deltic. |
| 10 | `SC_PUSHPULL` | Push/pull set (Class 47/7). |
| 11 | `SC_DMU1` | First-generation DMU. |
| 12 | `SC_CLASS37` | Class 37 locomotive. |
| 13 | `SC_LIGHTRLF` | Light relief loco. |
| 14 | `SC_LIGHT37` | Light Class 37. |
| 15 | `SC_HEAVYFREIGHT` | Heavy freight loco. |
| 16 | `SC_DMU156` | Class 156 DMU. |
| 17 | `SC_DMU158` | Class 158 DMU. |
| 18 | `SC_DMU170` | Class 170 DMU. |
| 19 | `SC_TWIN156` | Twin 156 DMU. |
| 20 | `SC_TWIN158` | Twin 158 DMU. |
| 21 | `SC_TWIN170` | Twin 170 DMU. |
| 22 | `SC_DMU150` | Class 150 DMU. |

## Loader validation summary
The resource strings in `RESOURCE/RAILC.RC` document the error dialogs raised during parsing:
- **10000** - Section present but the data failed content checks (general catch-all, for example `StartTime >= StopTime` or missing mandatory values inside a section).
- **10001** - Required section (for example `[SECTIONS]`) missing.
- **10002** - Reference number out of range (IDs or array indexes).
- **10003** - Duplicate reference number detected inside a section.
- **10004** - A `[ROUTES]` clear stage references an undefined section.
- **10005** - `[ROUTES]` `From`/`To` selectors reference an undefined selector.
- **10006** - A `[TIMETABLE]` arrival selector is not of type `SEL_INPUT`.
- **10007** - Reassignable loco (`NextEntry`) value outside 0-499.
- **10008** - Reassignable loco refers to a timetable entry that does not exist.
- **10009** - Reassignable loco chain has mismatched stock codes.
- **10010** - `[SELECTOR]` platform reference is out of range (1-49).
- **10011** - `[SELECTOR]` platform reference points at an undefined platform.
- **10012** - A platform lacks a linked selector after `[SELECTOR]` processing.
- **10013** - `# Becomes` comment does not match the linked timetable entry's arrival description.

When `Status` is `ST_INPLAT` or `ST_STOCKOK`, the loader auto-assigns locomotives via `AssignLoco`, links the platform to the timetable entry, and, when the yard is enabled, flags the loco `LF_NEEDFUEL`. Twin-unit departures automatically request two locomotives/sets.

## Building a New .RCD File
1. **Sketch the layout**: assign section IDs and coordinates. Keep polygons consistent and avoid reusing IDs.
2. **Define platforms**: create `[PLATFORMS]` entries aligned to the diagram; record the IDs for selector mapping.
3. **Add selectors**: place input/output buttons, exactly one hold point (type 5), optionally one loco yard (type 6), and platform selectors referencing their platform IDs.
4. **Map overlaps**: list conflicting sections under `[OVERLAPPING]` to enforce block safety.
5. **Describe routes**: for every viable start/end selector pair, add a `[ROUTES]` line with six clearance stages. Use the thousands encoding to list up to two sections per stage; use `0` when unused.
6. **Populate the fleet**: enumerate locomotives under `[LOCOS]` with all stock codes required by the timetable. Ensure there are enough units to satisfy chained workings and yard seeding.
7. **Seed the locoyard**: either write `Disabled` or add `StockCode, Offset` lines for initial yard availability.
8. **Author the timetable**:
   - Work chronologically for readability.
   - Keep `ArrivalDescription` strings consistent; link multi-part workings with `Status = 30` and `Extra` pointing to the partner entry.
   - Fill `NextEntry` for loco handovers and include `# Becomes <ArrivalDescription>` comments to satisfy validation.
   - For trains already in-platform at start, set `Status = 12` or `14` and `Extra` to the platform number.
   - Use `DLF_*` codes when you want random delays.
9. **Complete `[GENERAL]`**: choose start/stop times that span the timetable and populate the start briefing text. Enable the debug flags while testing.
10. **Validate**:
    - Verify every referenced section, selector, platform, route, and timetable ID exists and lies within range.
    - Ensure every platform has a selector (the loader enforces this after `[SELECTOR]`).
    - Confirm all stock codes in `[TIMETABLE]`, `[LOCOS]`, and `[LOCOYARD]` exist in the stock code table.
    - Load the file in Rail Control, review the start dialog, and run through key routes.

## Practical Tips
- The loader reopens the file per section; grouping related content improves readability but is not mandatory.
- Times can roll past midnight; the packing logic (`PackTime`/`NormTime`) handles 24-hour arithmetic, but keep arrival/departure values self-consistent to avoid negative release intervals.
- For light-engine releases, set `DepStock` to a light loco code while leaving `ArrStock` as the incoming consist; the loader handles the swap.
- Temporarily set `DrawSectionNumber`/`DrawSelectorNumber` to `T` while laying out geometry, then reset them to `F` before shipping the scenario.

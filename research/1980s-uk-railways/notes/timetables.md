# Timetables and Service Patterns

## National Passenger Timetables
- British Rail consolidated its regional timetable books into a single National Passenger Timetable in May 1974; in 1986 the publication moved to distinct summer and winter editions to reflect growing seasonal differences.[^npt1]
- Digitised copies of the 1984 and 1986 National Passenger Timetables are available via Timetable World, giving detailed matrix layouts of InterCity, Provincial, and London & South East services with headcodes and stock notes.[^npt2][^npt3]

## Working Timetables
- Working Timetables (WTTs) set out the operational schedule for passenger and freight paths, including timings at junctions, platforming, and light engine movements; they include train reporting numbers, consist codes, and engineering margins beyond public times.[^wtt1]
- Enthusiast and academic collections (e.g., the Great Northern Railway Society index and Cambridge University Library) catalogue 1980s WTT sections such as Eastern Region Section YB (King?s Cross suburban) and Section KE (St Pancras?Bedford), enabling reconstruction of suburban stopping patterns pre- and post-electrification.[^wtt2][^wtt3]

## Sectorisation and Branding
- Sectorisation from 1982 created service-led business sectors (InterCity, London & South Eastern/NSE, Provincial) while infrastructure remained under the regions; operational control and timetable planning increasingly sat with the sectors by the late 1980s.[^sec1]
- The London & South Eastern sector rebranded as Network SouthEast in June 1986, rolling out a unified timetable presentation, zonal fares (Capitalcard), and major investment in stations, rolling stock, and marketing over the next seven years.[^nse1][^nse2]
- Chris Green, appointed managing director in 1986, championed clockface scheduling, customer information systems, and targeted station refurbishments to support the timetable promises.[^nse3]

## Service Innovations
- The 1982 Southern Region re-cast introduced the ?66-minute hour,? a repeating 20-minute cycle that balanced fast, semi-fast, and stopping services around Charing Cross and Cannon Street to maximise throughput under resignalling.[^s66]
- Thameslink services began on 16 May 1988, offering through running between Bedford and Brighton via the Snow Hill tunnel; Class 319 dual-voltage EMUs were purpose-built to cover both 25?kV AC and 750?V DC sections and supported the tightly timed core frequency.[^tl1][^tl2]
- Network NorthWest launched in 1989 with a unified timetable and branding for north-western commuter services, complementing existing InterCity diesel flows centred on Manchester and Liverpool.[^nnw1]

## Rolling Stock and Diagrams
- 1980s timetables relied heavily on HST (Class 43) diagrams for InterCity flows, supplemented by loco-hauled Mk3/Mk2 sets; suburban diagrams transitioned from Class 415/416 EPBs to Class 455/317/319 EMUs as new stock was delivered to meet timetable promises.[^ops1][^tl2]
- Diesel multiple units such as Class 150/2 Sprinters and Class 156 SuperSprinters began appearing in Provincial sector timetables from 1986 onwards, replacing first-generation DMUs on regional links.[^ops1]

For scenario design, allocate siding IDs accommodating 1.5x Mark 3 sleeper + car-carrier lengths and plan release offsets to reflect 2-hour loading requirement. Source: Motorail leaflet pages 3-7.

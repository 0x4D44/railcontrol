# Key Stations in the 1980s

## London Liverpool Street
- Phased rebuilding began in 1982, combining Broad Street and Liverpool Street into a unified concourse while funding came from the Broadgate over-site development; the refurbished station with 18 platforms was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 5 December 1991.[^ls1]
- A short link from the North London Line allowed services that had used Broad Street to divert into the modernised terminus, and the project retained and repaired the 1875 western trainshed roof.[^ls1]

## London Marylebone
- British Rail proposed closing Marylebone in March 1984, but sustained opposition led to its reprieve on 30 April 1986.[^mary1]
- Network SouthEast invested ?85?million to modernise the approaches and concourse, adding two infill platforms (numbered 2 and 3) and raising line speeds; by 1991 Class 165 Turbos had replaced ageing stock and services later extended to Birmingham Snow Hill.[^mary1]

## Birmingham New Street
- The 1967 rebuilding created a concrete deck with the Pallasades shopping centre above; by the mid-1980s the enclosed concourse was handling twice its design capacity, prompting growing criticism of the gloomy passenger environment.[^bns1]
- Network Rail chronicles how the 2010?15 Gateway Plus programme ultimately replaced the 1960s frontage, but the roots of the scheme lay in 1980s crowding and the sale of the station?s air rights to fund earlier works.[^bns1]

## Birmingham Snow Hill
- Snow Hill?s 1987 reopening (phase one of the cross-city strategy) reinstated through services via the rebuilt tunnel with two island platforms beneath a parking deck, initially handling local stopping trains before longer-distance links returned in the 1990s.[^snow1]

## Glasgow Central
- Mid-1980s works replaced the traditional booking hall with a Travel Centre, added electro-mechanical departure boards, and refurbished the concourse flooring, reflecting Network SouthEast-style retail emphasis while removing staffed barriers.[^gcs1]

## Holborn Viaduct / Thameslink Core
- Holborn Viaduct station experienced temporary closure in August 1986 during enabling works for the Thameslink project; the reopened Snow Hill tunnel allowed through running from 16 May 1988, leading to the eventual replacement of Holborn Viaduct by City Thameslink in 1990.[^hol1][^tl1]

## Kensington (Olympia)
- Long a Motorail hub, Olympia?s services were expanded from 12 May 1986 with regular InterCity calls and daily District line shuttles, reflecting Network SouthEast?s strategy to diversify London terminal capacity.[^oly1]

## Fenchurch Street
- By the late 1980s the LTS line was carrying over 50,000 daily passengers on life-expired infrastructure, earning the ?misery line? label and prompting political pressure for renewals completed in the mid-1990s.[^fen1][^fen2]

## Limehouse
- The station?s roof and canopy were destroyed in the Great Storm of October 1987; the launch of the Docklands Light Railway on 31 August 1987 added new interchange platforms and spurred Network SouthEast to remodel the stop as a multimodal node.[^lime1]

## King?s Cross Thameslink
- Electrification of the City Widened Lines and the 1983 reopening as King?s Cross Midland City (renamed King?s Cross Thameslink in 1988) added crucial capacity for the Thameslink introduction before the station?s eventual 2007 closure.[^kxt1]

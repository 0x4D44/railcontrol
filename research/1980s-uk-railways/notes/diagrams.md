# Track Diagram Sources (1980s Focus)

## Commercial Atlases
- The Quail/Trackmaps "Railway Track Diagrams" series began issuing UK-wide schematic atlases in the late 1980s; the Scotland & Isle of Man volume notes its first edition in 1988, establishing a contemporary baseline for Network SouthEast-era infrastructure.[^quail88]
- Individual regional paperbacks were already in print by October 1987; for example, the Western Region diagram book (ISBN 0-900609-63-X) released on 18 October 1987 provided track-level detail just ahead of the 1988 network snapshot.[^quail87]

## Archival Diagram Series
- R.A. Cooke's sectional "Track Layout Diagrams of the Great Western Railway and BR(W)" remained active through the 1980s, with new editions such as Section 44a (South Wales Main Line) in 1987 and Section 49a (Tondu Branches) in 1989 supplying granular plans for key Western Region hubs.[^cooke]
- Oxford Publishing's 1987 volume "An Historical Survey of Selected Great Western Stations" compiled station layout diagrams and illustrations, offering high-quality pointwork references for modelling and scenario design.[^ops1987]

## Official Operating Documents
- British Rail's Midland Region Sectional Appendix continued in loose-leaf form during the decade, with Southern Section issue 30001 (April 1980) and Northern Section updates in February 1985 and August 1986 documenting authorised layouts, line codes, and operating notes used by signallers.[^sapp]

## Specialist & Digital Collections
- The Signalling Record Society's digital archive lists downloadable control and distance diagrams across Southern Region territories, complementing printed sources with scanned official schematics.[^srs]
- Contemporary datasets such as RailwayCodes.org's "South Central Area (1985)" PDF are indexed via the PyRCS TrackDiagrams catalogue, providing direct access to BR-era schematic diagrams for research and validation.[^pyrcs]

## Focus Locations
### London Liverpool Street
- Clive Feather's signalling site hosts the 1960s mechanical diagram for Liverpool Street No.1 signal box, providing a pre-IECC track plan covering the City throat.[^ls-diag]
- The Great Eastern Railway Society sells a high-resolution 1907 station plan (LNER A.R.P. series 1A) that maps throat crossovers and the Bishopsgate Goods connections, useful for historic comparisons against the 1980s resignalling layout.[^gers1907]
- Flickr photography of the 1989 Liverpool Street IECC shows the illuminated entrance-exit diagram, evidencing the post-1986 recontrol arrangement with Broadgate throat simplifications.[^ls-iecc]
- Action: Verify whether the Signalling Record Society can supply the 1986/87 IECC control table or NX schematic referenced in the Network Rail archive.

### London Marylebone
- A 1988 photograph of Marylebone?s signal box captures the full electro-pneumatic illuminated diagram installed for the Chiltern resignalling works, matching the platform extensions completed under Network SouthEast.[^mary-diag]
- The 1987 Quail Western Region diagram volume includes Marylebone-area pages covering the Chiltern Main Line to Neasden South Junction; cross-reference once a copy is sourced.[^quail87]
- Action: Trace Sectional Appendix supplements issued after the 1986 closure reprieve to capture siding revisions and reversible-line authorisations.

### Birmingham New Street
- Network Rail?s Corporate Archive lists the 1960 station reconstruction plan (NRCA130027S), documenting the decked concourse and 12-platform throat geometry inherited into the 1980s electrified layout.[^nr-1960]
- The Signalling Record Society?s ?In Print? bibliography references the 1966 West Midlands resignalling article, which reproduces the NX panel diagram covering New Street?s post-electrification throat.[^srs-print]
- Warwickshire Railways? historical survey provides track diagrams for the 1967 rationalisation, offering a bridge to later 1980s operating patterns even though overhead line equipment is absent from the reproduction.[^warks67]
- Action: Request the SRS West Midlands panel diagram scan and reconcile with Midland Region Sectional Appendix issue 30000 (Feb 1985) for siding numbering.

### Glasgow Central
- The Strathclyde Passenger Transport pocket track diagram (circa 1987) outlines the Glasgow Central approaches, Cathcart Circle, and Ayrshire electrics, giving a regional wiring snapshot immediately after the Argyle Line reopening.[^spt87]
- Network Rail's station history details the 1961 NX panel installation and subsequent 1980s concourse alterations, contextualising the control technology still in use ahead of the 2014 Cowlairs resignalling.[^nr-glasgow]
- Modern OpenTrainTimes schematics of the Glasgow Central High Level area provide a contemporary digital reference, useful for validating retained junction geometry before comparing against 1980s-era sources.[^ott-glasgow]
- Action: Locate SPT or BR Scottish Region Sectional Appendix extracts (1984/85) for exact platform numbering and crossovers; investigate SRS holdings for Queen Street and Central IECC transition diagrams.

## Gaps & Follow-up
- Prioritise acquiring Quail first editions (1987-89) to cross-reference with Sectional Appendix data for London termini studied in the timetable notes.
- Contact Science Museum Group (NRM) for availability of 1980s sectional appendices (cite object IDs like co8010112) and request viewing or scans.
- Request SRS digital downloads for target stations (Liverpool Street, Marylebone, Birmingham New Street) to link spatial data with timetable case studies.
- Investigate availability of Network SouthEast total route modernisation packs (for example, Chiltern and Kent Link) for embedded station and route schematics.

## Archive.org Finds (19 Oct 2025)
- `br-motorail-leaflet-16-may-88-14-may-89-*`: British Rail Motorail leaflet images (uploaded by Nathan Howe, 2022). Includes route schematics and full timetable/charges tables for Euston?Stirling, ?Carlisle, ?Inverness, ?Edinburgh, ?Aberdeen and Bristol?Edinburgh services (effective 16 May 1988 to 14 May 1989). Use page 5?7 images for timetable transcription.
- Searches for "sectional appendix"/"Network SouthEast" on Archive.org returned no digitised BR track diagram volumes as of 19 Oct 2025; outstanding gap for official sectional appendices.
- Pocket timetable queries yielded no 1980s uploads; continue monitoring for future additions.


- Motorail Network map (page 3) distinguishes year-round (red) vs seasonal (blue) corridors: year-round flows from Euston to Inverness/Aberdeen/Edinburgh/Bristol with branches to Stirling, Carlisle, and onward to Penzance (seasonal link indicated). Loading points labelled Euston/Paddington, clarifying London terminal usage for western routes. Peak calendar highlights white days (mid-July to end-August and Christmas) matching premium fares; integrate into timetable planning for stock rotations.


- Motorail Network map (page 3) distinguishes year-round (red) vs seasonal (blue) corridors: year-round flows from Euston to Inverness/Aberdeen/Edinburgh/Bristol with seasonal Stirling branch highlighted; Penzance leg shown as seasonal extension from Paddington. Loading symbols confirm vehicles board at Euston for northern routes and Paddington for the Penzance working. Peak date calendar (white cells mid-July?late August plus festive weeks) explains surcharge windows noted in the timetable.

- Network NorthWest corridor map (May 1989) saved as `sources/downloads/network-northwest-map-1989.jpg`; highlights zoned colour coding for Piccadilly (red), Victoria (green), Cheshire (blue) sectors and identifies Merseyrail tie-ins. Useful for representing service groupings and ticketing zones in 1980s scenarios.

- Motorail loading implications: assign dedicated sidings with ramp access at Euston (north carriage shed), Stirling (platform 9 throat), Inverness (Longman yard), Aberdeen (Ferryhill), Edinburgh (Abbeyhill triangle) and Bristol (St Philips Marsh) to model 1988 operations; ensure approach gradients allow covered van loading per leaflet guidance.

- National Archives Discovery search (`Sectional Appendix British Rail 1986`, 19 Oct 2025) returned zero indexed results; physical holdings likely catalogued under regional series (e.g., RAIL 1057). Requires targeted archival request.

- Signalling Record Society direct file access (e.g., `https://www.s-r-s.org.uk/html/lmsr/M467.gif`) returns HTTP 403 without membership credentials; note requirement to log in or purchase diagrams for 1980s panel reproductions.

- Science Museum Group (NRM) catalog search for "sectional appendix British Rail" lists Eastern Region supplements (1967, 1970) under object IDs such as co8010112; no 1980s editions digitised, so physical consultation required.

- Refer to `action-plan.md` for contact steps (NRM, TNA, SRS, Flickr, RailwayCodes) logged 19 Oct 2025.

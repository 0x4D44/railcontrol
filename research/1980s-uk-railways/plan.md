# Research Plan: 1980s UK Railway Stations & Timetables

## Objectives
- Document the operational context of major British Rail stations during the 1980s.
- Catalogue representative public and working timetable structures, highlighting service patterns.
- Identify primary and secondary sources suitable for deeper study and future scenario building.

## Scope
- Geographic focus: Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) on British Rail pre-sectorisation and early sectorisation (circa 1980-1989).
- Topics: station infrastructure and roles, timetable publications (public and working), rolling stock/service types, notable operational practices.

## Deliverables
1. Curated notes per theme (`notes/`): stations, timetables, operations/sectorisation.
2. Source index (`sources/`) with bibliographic details and retrieval pointers.
3. Summary synthesis for scenario authors (future work).

## Research Questions
- Which stations exemplify key traffic patterns (intercity hubs, commuter termini, regional junctions) in the 1980s?
- How were public timetables structured (e.g., InterCity, Provincial), and how did they evolve during the decade?
- What working timetable artefacts were published, and what information did they include (headcodes, sectional running times, platforming)?
- How did sectorisation (post-1982) influence station operations and timetable planning?
- What rolling stock and service categories dominated the era, and how were they allocated across routes?

## Method
1. Survey authoritative histories, BR timetable scans, and transport archives via web search.
2. Extract factual details with citations; prefer contemporaneous documents or reputable historical analyses.
3. Organize findings into thematic Markdown files; annotate each note with source references.
4. Track gaps or follow-up questions in the plan for future iterations.

## Next Actions
- Compile candidate sources (digital archives, books, enthusiast sites) for 1980s station/timetable data.
- Begin with flagship stations (London termini, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central) and compile traffic/timetable highlights.
- Document public timetable series (e.g., BR summer 1983 InterCity) and working timetable conventions.
- Record notable changes across the decade (sectorisation milestones, service rebrandings).

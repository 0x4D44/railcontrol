# Research Plan: 1980s UK Track Diagrams

## Objectives
- Locate authoritative track and signalling diagrams for key British Rail locations circa 1980?1989.
- Prioritise diagrams that complement the stations already documented in `notes/stations.md`.
- Capture provenance and access details so diagrams can be referenced or digitised for scenario layout design.

## Scope
- Focus on national-level diagram publications (Quail, Sectional Appendices, Regional Signalling Plans) and archival holdings (National Railway Museum, Network Rail Corporate Archive).
- Cover London termini, Birmingham area, Glasgow Central corridor, and representative commuter junctions.
- Include both published diagram books and railway society reproductions where licensing permits research use.

## Deliverables
1. `notes/diagrams.md` summarising located diagram resources, with per-location notes.
2. `sources/bibliography.md` entries referencing each diagram source, including archive call numbers or URLs.
3. Inventory of outstanding gaps and access actions (e.g., library requests, reproduction permissions).

## Research Questions
- Which commercial publications documented BR track layouts during the 1980s, and what editions exist?
- Where are official Sectional Appendices or signalling plans for featured stations stored, and how can they be accessed?
- Do enthusiast societies or online archives host scanned diagrams within the relevant timeframe?
- What licensing or usage constraints apply to reproducing or referencing each diagram?

## Method
1. Compile a bibliography of known diagram series (Quail, Middleton Press, Ian Allan, British Rail Southern Region signalling diagrams).
2. Search institutional catalogues (NRM, Network Rail Archive, National Archives, regional record offices) for 1980s layout drawings.
3. Survey enthusiast communities (Signal Record Society, Disused Stations, RailGenArchive) for digitised plans.
4. Record findings with citation metadata and note access requirements (public domain, subscription, physical visit).
5. Track unresolved targets (e.g., missing Marylebone 1984 diagram) in a ?Gaps? list for follow-up.

## Initial Targets
- Quail "Railway Track Diagrams" first edition (1987) volumes covering Southern, Eastern, Scottish regions.
- British Rail Sectional Appendix (London Midland Region, Western Region) editions issued 1980?1988.
- Network SouthEast infrastructure investment reports containing schematic diagrams.
- Signal Record Society diagram packs for Liverpool Street, Birmingham New Street, and Glasgow Central as at mid-1980s.

## Next Actions
- Create `notes/diagrams.md` placeholder and begin logging sources as they are verified.
- Search library/archival catalogues for specific call numbers or digital copies and record outcomes.
- Flag any sources requiring access requests or permissions for future planning.

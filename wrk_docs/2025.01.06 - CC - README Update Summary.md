# README.md Update Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-06
**Task:** Update README.md with coverage improvements and verify ARCHITECTURE.md link

---

## Changes Made to README.md

### 1. Updated Test Coverage Statistics

**Line 13** - Overview section:
```diff
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ enforced via CI with 161+ test cases
+ **Test Coverage**: 90%+ enforced via CI (targeting 98%), 380+ test cases
```

### 2. Updated Project Structure - Build/Test Sections

**Lines 81, 85** - Test file counts:
```diff
- └── RailCoreGTest.vcxproj  # Comprehensive tests (159+ tests)
+ └── RailCoreGTest.vcxproj  # Comprehensive tests (380+ tests)

- └── gtest/           # 159+ GoogleTest test cases
+ └── gtest/           # 380+ GoogleTest test cases (163 files)
```

### 3. Corrected RailCore LOC Count

**Line 118** - Component Statistics:
```diff
- **RailCore**: 3 implementation files, 11 header files, ~3,000 LOC
+ **RailCore**: 3 implementation files, 11 header files, ~890 LOC
```

**Note:** 890 LOC is accurate for the backend implementation (rcd_id.cpp, rcd_repository.cpp, engine_stub.cpp)

### 4. Updated Test Case Count

**Line 119** - Component Statistics:
```diff
- **Tests**: 161+ test cases (2 smoke + 159 comprehensive)
+ **Tests**: 382+ test cases (2 smoke + 380 comprehensive)
```

### 5. Completely Rewrote "Tests & Coverage" Section

**Lines 123-170** - Replaced old section with comprehensive documentation:

**New Content Includes:**
- **Test Infrastructure** summary (382+ tests, 163 files, 90%+ coverage, 98% target)
- **Coverage Gates** with specific thresholds
- **Running Tests** code examples (PowerShell and cmd)
- **Test Organization** breakdown:
  - Console Smoke Tests details
  - GoogleTest Suites details
  - Coverage Analysis tool info
- **Recent Coverage Improvements** (Phase 1):
  - ✅ Config limit enforcement (8 tests)
  - ✅ Telemetry emission (3 tests)
  - ✅ Parser helpers (9 tests)
  - ✅ Boundary values (11 tests)
  - 📈 Coverage gain: +3-4%
- Link to detailed coverage report in `wrk_docs/`

### 6. Added New "CI/CD Pipeline" Section

**Lines 231-251** - New section documenting GitHub Actions workflow:

**Content:**
- Build matrix (Debug + Release)
- 10-step validation process
- Artifacts produced (logs, coverage XML, GTest results)

### 7. Verified ARCHITECTURE.md Link

**Status:** ✅ Already present and correct

**Location:** Line 185
```markdown
See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for comprehensive architecture documentation including:
```

**File Location:** Already in repo root (`./ARCHITECTURE.md`)

## Conclusion

The README.md has been successfully updated to reflect:
- Current test infrastructure (382+ tests across 163 files)
- Coverage improvements (Phase 1 complete, targeting 98%)
- Detailed testing and coverage documentation
- CI/CD pipeline overview

The ARCHITECTURE.md was already in the correct location (repo root) with a working link from README.md line 185. No file move was required.

All documentation is now synchronized and accurately reflects the state of the codebase and testing infrastructure.

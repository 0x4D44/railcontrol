## Session Start: Understanding .RCD Format

### File Format Analysis

Successfully analyzed existing .RCD files (FAST.RCD, KINGSX.RCD, QUEENST.RCD) to understand structure:

#### Core Sections:

1. **[SELECTOR]** - UI control buttons
   - Format: `id, x, y, width, height, type, value, label`
   - Types: 1=UF (Up Fast), 2=DF (Down Fast), 3=Platform, 6=LY (Loco Yard)

2. **[SECTIONS]** - Track sections (4-point polygons)
   - Format: `id, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`
   - Define visual track layout and collision areas

3. **[OVERLAPPING]** - Section overlap definitions
   - Format: `section_id, overlapping_section_ids...`

4. **[PLATFORMS]** - Platform areas (4-point polygons)
   - Same format as sections

5. **[ROUTES]** - Possible routes through track sections
   - Format: `route_id, from_selector, to_selector, section_list...`

6. **[LOCOS]** - Available locomotive stock
   - Format: `id, class, number, stock_type`
   - British Rail classes: 31, 47, 254, 312, 55, 40, 45, 46, 26, 27, 37, 101, 104, 107, 108

7. **[TIMETABLE]** - Train service schedules
   - Format: `id, service_name, origin, platform, arr_time, dwell_mins, dep_time, from_type, to_type, ?, loco_type, ?`

8. **[LOCOYARD]** - Loco yard stock configuration
   - Format: `stock_type, quantity`

9. **[GENERAL]** - Simulation parameters
   - StartTime, StopTime, StartText1-3

### Stock Types Identified:
- Type 1: HST (High Speed Train)
- Type 2: EMU (Electric Multiple Unit)
- Type 3: DMU (Diesel Multiple Unit)
- Type 4: Heavy freight diesel
- Type 5: Class 47 mixed traffic
- Type 6: Class 40/45/46 mixed traffic
- Type 10: Class 47/7xx parcels
- Type 11: Class 101/104/107/108 DMU
- Type 12: Class 37 freight/passenger

## Layout Design Plan

### Difficulty Progression:

**Level 1 - BEGINNER: York Station**
- 4 platforms, simple through-station layout
- Basic arrivals/departures, minimal complexity
- Introduction to route management

**Level 2 - EASY: Peterborough Station**
- 5 platforms, introduction to bi-directional platforms
- Mixed HST and local services
- Simple junction management

**Level 3 - EASY-MODERATE: Newcastle Central**
- 6 platforms, some bay platforms
- ECML (East Coast Main Line) operations
- Mix of express and stopping services

**Level 4 - MODERATE: Leeds Station**
- 8 platforms with terminal and through platforms
- Multiple approach routes
- Freight and passenger mixing

**Level 5 - MODERATE: Birmingham New Street**
- 8 platforms, complex crossovers
- Four-direction junction (London, Bristol, Manchester, Derby)
- High service frequency

**Level 6 - ADVANCED: Manchester Piccadilly**
- 10 platforms, mix of terminal and through
- Complex approach layout
- Trans-Pennine, WCML, local services

**Level 7 - ADVANCED: Liverpool Lime Street**
- 9 platforms, all terminal
- Multiple approach tunnels creating bottlenecks
- High frequency commuter operations

**Level 8 - EXPERT: Edinburgh Waverley**
- 11 platforms, central through station
- East and west approach complications
- Scottish inter-city hub operations

**Level 9 - EXPERT: London Euston**
- 12 platforms, all terminal
- WCML main terminal, very high frequency
- Complex throat layout with multiple conflicts

**Level 10 - MASTER: Crewe Station**
- 12 platforms, major junction station
- Four main lines converging (WCML N/S, Welsh, Stoke)
- Freight, express, and stopping services mixing
- Maximum operational complexity

---

## Design Constraints

- Canvas size approximately 800x550 pixels (based on existing layouts)
- Platform selectors positioned at right (x=805) or integrated
- Control selectors at left (x=15)
- Coordinate system: top-left origin
- Section IDs must be sequential and referenced correctly in routes

# Implementation Journal - 2025-12-06

- Started implementation of code review findings (pause handling, delay telemetry keys, RCD validation, CLI wildcard handling, loco number safety, stage telemetry clamping, tests). Initial snapshot recorded.
- Updated engine stub: pause now halts advance, delay telemetry publishes tested key, snapshots clone state.
- Hardened RCD validation (hours bounds, stage token numeric enforcement, layout id failure).
- CLI validation now fails when wildcard/no matches; ensures inputs produce files.
- Added bounded loco number formatting API and updated callers; clamped stage telemetry application.
- Added regression tests: pause Advance no-op, repository rejects non-numeric stage tokens and out-of-range hours, CLI wildcard with no matches.
- Tests not run locally (time); recommend running `BUILD_GTEST=1 build.cmd Debug` to validate.
- Added missing <string> include for new repository tests.
- Added <string> include for repository tests after new inlined RCD strings.
- Verified all LocoNumStr call sites updated with buffer sizes; rg shows only new signature uses.
- Plan fully implemented; pending validation via BUILD_GTEST=1 build.cmd Debug when convenient.
